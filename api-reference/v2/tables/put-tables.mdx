Overwrite an existing Glide Big Table by clearing all rows and adding new data. You can also update the table schema.

<Warning>
This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Overwrite Table w/ Row Data">
    If you want to reset a table's data with a small number of rows, you can do so by providing the data inline in the `rows` field (being sure that row object structure matches the table schema):

    ```json
    {
        "rows": [
            {
                "fullName": "Alex Bard",
                "ageInYears": 30,
                "hiredOn": "2021-07-03"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    However, this is only appropriate for relatively small initial datasets (around a few hundred rows or less, depending on schema complexity). If you need to work with a larger dataset you should utilize stashing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Overwrite Table from Stash">
    [Stashing](/api-reference/v2/stashing/introduction) is our process for handling the upload of large datasets. Break down your dataset into smaller, more manageable, pieces and [upload them to a single stash ID](/api-reference/v2/stashing/post-stashes-serial). 

    Then, to reset a table's data from the stash, use the `$stashID` reference in the `rows` field instead of providing the data inline:

    ```json
    {
        "rows": {
            "$stashID": "20240215-job32"
        }
    }
    ```
